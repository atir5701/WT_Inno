                        Fern Hospitals is Indian organisation which was established in Ahmedabad as a joint replacement 
                        centre in 1994 by Dr. Vikram Shah.
                        Fern today runs a chain of 11 multi-specialty hospitals in Ahmedabad, Surat, Indore, Vapi, Jabalpur, 
                        Jaipur, udaipur and Mohali.
                        <br>
                        By 2007, it had become a 200-bed multi-specialty hospital. It works in 40 medical disciplines ranging 
                        from cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, dental care, oncology and trauma to ENT.
                        <br>
                        In 2011, it acquired a 55 per cent stake in the Vrundavan Hospital in Goa, which had 120 beds across 
                        two units. In 2012 Fern 
                        acquired Krishna Hospital for an estimated Rs 75 crore, to become the biggest private corporate 
                        hospital in Ahmedabad.By 2012 the company had 450 beds in Ahmedabad.
                        <br>
                        In 2013, Shah claimed the hospital in Ahmedabad completed an average of 30 joint replacement 
                        surgeries a day, at which point they had 705 employees.
                        <br>
                        During the period 1994–2009, the joint replacement team performed more than 20,000 TKR procedures.
                        The length of surgical time in the hospital had been dramatically reduced from 1 hour, 20 mins per TKR to around 10–12 minutes susing the "ZERO Technique" 
                        invented by Dr. Vikram Shah. Over the years, Fern has performed over 1,00,000 Joint Replacement Surgeries
                        <br>

                        At the time, it was the only hospital in Gujarat to have this.
